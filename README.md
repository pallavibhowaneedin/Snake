## Running Java Files in Visual Studio Code

Make sure you have the necessary Java extensions installed in VS Code.

### Steps

1. **Configure the Run Configuration**
   - Open the Java file you want to execute.
   - Click the **Run** button in the top-right corner of VS Code.

2. **Select or Configure the Main Class**
   - If your Java file contains a main class (with a `public static void main` method), VS Code should detect it automatically.
   - If not, you will be prompted to select or create a run configuration.
   - You can also manually configure the launch settings in the `launch.json` file.

3. **Run the File**
   - Press **F5** or click the **Run** button to execute the Java file.
